/*
This program calculates a users sleep debt. Ideally, we'd input 
the user's sleep data in fromt FitBit or something like that, 
but I'm just a beginner. I made up hours of sleep #s for seven 
days of a standard week and stored them in a switch statement. 
The hours slept are calculated from that switch statement. 
And the ideal # of hours of sleep are determined based on a 
single night * 7. Then, there's an if/else structure that determines
if the user is getting too much, not enough, or just the right
amount of sleep. A console.log is used to display that info.
