/*
This Codecademy Javascript exercise is called Message Mixer. At the start of the
exercise, you are provided with a single Javascript file that contains a variety
of text transformation functions. This Codecademy exercise requires you to keep
the functions in messageMixer.js, as a module, and move the function calls into 
message.js. In this file, commented code that starts out as "//REMNANT" was code
that was initially present in the file. It's commented out now because of the 
seperation of the functions from the function calling. 
*/

/*
This imports all of the functions that messageMixer.js exported.
*/
import { countCharacter, capitalizeFirstCharacterOfWords, reverseWord, reverseAllWords, replaceFirstOccurence, replaceAllOccurrences, encode, palindrome, pigLatin} from './messageMixer';
/*
The displayMessage() function uses console.log() to print out all of the messageMixer.js functions that were imported earlier. Everything is called
with the string "What is the color of the sky?". I could improve this program
by having a prompt window asking for the text to be replaced, BUT Codecademy refuses
to recognize prompt as a command; I have encountered this problem many times previously & I 
do not know how to address it. Each function call is prepended by a console.log that explains
the upcoming function AND then there's a console.log() that prints a series of "-----------"
to make things easier to read.
