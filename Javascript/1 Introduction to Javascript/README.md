This is my first Javascript program, so nearly everything is new to me. Here is an explanation of all the different types of code that I used:
To create a single line comment in Javascript, use two forward slashes "//"
To create a multi-line comment in Javascript, use /* to start & */ to end.
Confirm will open a dialog box w/ the text in between the quotes w/ default "OK" and "Cancel" options.
console.log("will print whatever is in between the quotes");
Semicolons need to end most lines ... I'm still figuring this out. For example, semicolons aren't needed after the closing parenthesis for if/else statements and aren't needed after closing curly brackets.
If/else statements are a great way to control the flow of various answer choices. Else statements don't have conditions & they come after if statements, which have conditions inside of the parenthesis. The parenthesis contain logical operators; in this exercise, I use less than "<", greater than ">" and "===". Less than and greater than are obvious, but "===" initially confused me, especially in comparison to "=." The triple equal sign checks for equivalence in logical operators. The single "=" is for creating, or updating, a variable. 
Javascript prompt is slightly different than the confirm in that the prompt asks a question and then can record the users answer into a variable.
