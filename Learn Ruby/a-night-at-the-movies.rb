The "A Night at the Movies" project is the concluding exercise for the Learn Ruby unit 6 track called "Hashes and Symbols."
This work is part of Codecademy's Full Stack Web Developer Program that I am working on.
This program maintains a list of movies in a hash, with movie ratings, and allows for new movies to be added, current movies 
to be deleted, current movies to get updated ratings and for all movies in the hash to be displayed.

puts "-- Type 'update' to update a movie."
puts "-- Type 'display' to display all movies."
puts "-- Type 'delete' to delete a movie."
