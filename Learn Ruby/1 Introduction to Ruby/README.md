This is a review of the Ruby methods I used to finish this section of the Codecademy Web Developer track.

Print and puts are similar methods. Print does not add a new line. The difference between the two is that puts adds a new line AND does *not* list "nil" values. Both need string values in quotes.
Chomp removes the enter character from the string's end. Gets would pick up the final enter without the chomp acommand ... it'd be listed as having "\n" in addition to the inputted text without the chomp.
Capitalize and upper have similar results. Capitalize will capitalize only the first letter. Call this command by adding ".capitalize". The upcase method would capitalize the entered string ... that's what we do with the capitailze state part.
Expressions inside of #{} are evaluate before being included in the string. That's how the final output is created.
# by itself, at the start of a new line is for creating a single line comment.
